# Sparkling Water

Sparkling Water allows users to combine the fast, scalable machine learning algorithms of H2O with the capabilities of Spark. 
With Sparkling Water, users can drive computation from Scala/R/Python and utilize the H2O Flow UI, providing an ideal 
machine learning platform for application developers.

H2O combined with Spark for ML Lifecycles typically involves data munging with the help of a Spark API, where a
prepared table is passed to the H2O ML algorithm. All FE process must be made in Spark. H2O will handle only the pure ML part of the framework.
