## Anomaly Detection

Anomaly detection is a supervised ml approach where we try to determine instances in data that deviate from the normal behavior. 
The objective of a trained model in this situation is to identify the **anomalies**. In this approach, the model needs to 
identify significant deviations from the training dataset (model needs to detect the difference between anomalies and 
infrequent values).

# Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Clustering


## PCA

PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is an unsupervised technique used to reduce the feature space. It's a mechanism used to 
reduce the dimensionality of our data. 

We take a large dataset with several features, apply the PCA algorithm (set of transformations) and as a result
we will get a transformed dataset with a reduced number of feature (objective is to keep only relevant features to 
describe our data).
