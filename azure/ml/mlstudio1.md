## Creating Azure ML Studio Workspace

First we need to go to resources and select the Machine Learning Resources. After that we need to enter the required 
information in order to validate and create the resource. Once the ML resource is ready we can enter access it and 
select the ML Studio button. Next, we need to select account and resource group in order to validate and create our 
ML Studio Environment.
