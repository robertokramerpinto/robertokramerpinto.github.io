# Azure Machine Learning 

Azure machine learning is an fully equipped cloud environment designed to deliver end-to-end ML solutions.  In summary,
it's a cloud-based environment you can use to train, deploy, automate, manage, and track ML models.

It integrates several Azure services, from data, modeling, DevOps and other tools, facilitating a robust implementation 
of complex analytical solutions. 

**Why to use Azure Machine Learning?**
- Simplify ML building models with AutomatedML
- Easy scaling model training in a cloud environment
- Use Python SDK and any Python open source frameworks & tools
- Manage workflows with DevOps for machine learning
- Simple deployment with cloud hosted endpoints

This is also a general picture of the end-to-end Ml cycle integrating several Azure ML tools:

User can interact with Azure ML resources in several ways. For example:

In general terms, machine learning workflows can be processed using Azure Machine Learning resources from distinct ways:
- Azure ML Studio 
- Python SDK (Software Development Kit)
- Azure ML CLI (Commmand Line Interface)

All ways will provide the user functions to run ml workflows using Azure ML Resources & Tools. 


# Azure ML Workspace

The Azure ML workspace is the top-level resource for Azure Machine learning.

It's a centralized environment used to:
- Manage all resources used to build,train and deploy ml models
- Store assets created during the ML workflow

Each workspace is tied to an Azure subscription and resource group, and has an associated SKU. Ideally each project should
have its own Azure ML Workspace.  

The workspace keeps a history of all training runs, including logs, metrics, output, and a snapshot of your scripts. 
You use this information to determine which training run produces the best model.

### Major Components of the Azure Machine Learning Workspace

> Compute Instances
- Cloud resources with Python environment
- User can use compute instances to develop and run ML pipelines independently 

> User Roles
- Share a workspace with other users, teams or projects

> Compute Targets
- Used to run experiments
- From a compute instance we can attache ML pipelines to compute targets so our jobs can be executed

> Experiments
- Train runs to build models

> Pipelines
- Reusable workflows for training and retraining models

> Datasets
- Aid with data management

> Registered Model 
- Created after we are ready to deploy our models

> Notebooks 
- We can launch notebooks to run ML pipelines

> Automated ML
- AutoML framework to develop automated ml pipelines

> Deployment Endpoint
- Final step, a combination of the registered model and scoring script

## Workspace Connection Python SDK

In order to run azure ml pipelines through Python SDK, our initial starting point will be the Azure ML Workspace.

In this scenario, it's possible to create a new workspace or to connect your app to an existing one. Let's see how this 
works.

### Connecting to an existing WS

When connecting to an existing Azure ML Workspace we need first to authenticate our access to the resources. This can 
be done through 2 distinct ways: a manual and an automated process. On the manual process, we pass to the program some
basic information about the WS and the authentication step is done manually through an URL (in case of working with
notebooks for example). Under the automated process, we need to create an application token, give access to that application
inside the existing WS and then connect it automatically. 

In both cases, it's indicated to use a config.json file with WS information. This config.json file can be directly download in the portal
accessing the WS settings. 

Here, we can see an example of such config.json file:
````json
{
    "subscription_id": "974f9871-2375-47c7-bfd5-54e55b74fbdd",
    "resource_group": "cloudgurutraining",
    "workspace_name": "test_1"
}
````

````python
# 01_connect_workspace.py file
from azureml.core import Workspace

def get_ws():
    ws = Workspace.from_config()
    return ws

if __name__=='__main__':
    ws = get_ws()
    print(ws)
````
````
python 01_connect_workspace.py 
````

After running the shell command, a new window will be prompt asking us for manual authentication.

**Automatic Authentication**

When setting up a machine learning workflow as an automated process, it's recommend 
using Service Principal Authentication. This approach decouples the authentication from any specific user login, and allows managed access control.

* Azure Portal >> Azure Active Directory >> Apps Registrations >> Create new application
* Copy Application (client) ID and Tentant (directory) ID 
* Select certificates & secrets (left menu) >> +new client secret >> copy client secret
* Go to IAM from the ML resource and add role to the registered application (add role assignment): grant access to resources for the specific tenant_id.  
* Recommendation is not to hardcode these passwords but instead use environment variables ($env:AZUREML_PASSWORD = "my-password")

````python
from azureml.core import Workspace
from azureml.core.authentication import ServicePrincipalAuthentication
import argparse

class AzureWorkspace():
    def __init__(self):
        self.subscription_id = "974f9871-2375-47c7-bfd5-54e55b74fbdd"
        self.resource_group="cloudgurutraining"
        self.workspace_name="test_1"
        self.my_application_id = "e8f02d4d-9d0b-4abb-93ed-ed365ebee25f"
        self.my_tenant_id = "e2c5fd58-d9bc-4c31-9495-bad58ae11f15"
        self.secret = "_w_pL4RF5h.4FKysfN3.dlqtM~X-2aNtT1"

def get_manual_ws():
    ws = Workspace.from_config()
    return ws

def get_automatic_ws():
    workspace = AzureWorkspace()

    svc_pr = ServicePrincipalAuthentication(
        tenant_id=workspace.my_tenant_id,
        service_principal_id=workspace.my_application_id,
        service_principal_password=workspace.secret)

    ws = Workspace(
        subscription_id=workspace.subscription_id,
        resource_group=workspace.resource_group,
        workspace_name=workspace.workspace_name,
        auth=svc_pr
    )
    return ws


if __name__=='__main__':
    parser  = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument(
        "--ws_auth_type",
        type=int
    )
    args = parser.parse_args()

    type_authentication = args.ws_auth_type
    if type_authentication == 1:
        ws = get_manual_ws()
    elif type_authentication == 2:
        ws = get_automatic_ws()
    else:
        print("Not a valid authentication type")

    print(ws)
````

After running the automated option:

````
python 01_connect_workspace.py --ws_auth_type 2
````

We get the desired output from the Workspace connection:

````
Workspace.create(name='test_1', subscription_id='974f9871-2375-47c7-bfd5-54e55b74fbdd', resource_group='cloudgurutraining')
````
